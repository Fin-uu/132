# AI Agent Instructions

This file provides essential context to help AI coding assistants be productive in this codebase.

## Project Overview

*This is a new project. As the codebase grows, document high-level architecture, major components, and data flows here.*

## Key Developer Workflows

### Build & Run
*Document build commands, run configurations, and environment setup as they are established*

### Testing
*Add testing conventions and commands once test infrastructure is in place*

### Common Development Tasks
*Document frequently performed development workflows as patterns emerge*

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Code Organization
*Document structural conventions and architectural patterns as they evolve*

### Important Integration Points
*List key external dependencies and integration patterns as they are added*

### Common Gotchas
*Document non-obvious pitfalls and solutions as they are discovered*

## Reference Files & Examples

*As the codebase grows, list key files that demonstrate important patterns:*

- Architecture examples: *(e.g. core services, key interfaces)*
- Implementation patterns: *(e.g. common usage examples)*
- Configuration: *(e.g. important settings files)*
